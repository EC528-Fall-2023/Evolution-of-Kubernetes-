1. Code to get number of distinct connection for each version:
MATCH (node)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(folder:Folder)
OPTIONAL MATCH (node)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:PackageNode)
WITH folder, COUNT(DISTINCT node) AS totalNodeCount, COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN labels(node) = ['PackageNode'] THEN node END) AS packageNodeCount
OPTIONAL MATCH (node)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:SPDXNode)
RETURN folder.name AS FolderNode, totalNodeCount, packageNodeCount, totalNodeCount - packageNodeCount AS SPDXNodeCount
ORDER BY folder.name;
